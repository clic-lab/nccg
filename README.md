Uses the following code:

1. SPF and AMR code maintained by Yoav Artzi.
2. Stanford parser (BLAH)
3. CCG Supertagging (BLAH)

# Pre Requisite

 - java 8.0.
 - 

# Instructions for using the code

It is best to use the code with Eclipse. Instructions below assume you are using Eclipse.

## Import the code in Eclipse

- Import all the java projects in nn-amr-dev. 

  - To import projects, first open eclipse and change the workspace folder to the root folder of ./nccg. 
  - Now go to File->Import->General->Existing Projects Into Workspace and select the nn-amd-dev folder in the root.
  - You should see the amr project. Select it. You should now see amr in the project explorer. Ignore any errors for now.
- Now import all the java projects in nn-ccg-dev similar to above.
- Close the following projects tiny, learn.ubl and learn.weakp (right click on the project and click on close the project).
