Development proxy test for small sentences. Including model testing only. This is a quick experiment for sanity checks. It prunes all sentences that are longer than 8 tokens or contain ';', '(', ')' (this avoid weird keywords).

Stages:
	log model
	testing (data set: amr-release-1.0-dev-proxy.txt)

Experiments:
	dev.proxy.quick.test.exp -- single machine experiment.
		modelFile=<model file>
	dev.proxy.quick.test.dist.exp -- distributed experiment.
		modelFile=<model file>
