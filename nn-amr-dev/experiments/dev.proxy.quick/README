Duevelopment proxy experiment for small sentences. Including training a model from scratch and testing it. This is a quick experiment for sanity checks. It prunes all sentences that are longer than 8 tokens or contain ';', '(', ')' (this avoid weird keywords).

Stages:
	init model (seed lexicon + weights)
	log model
	training (data set: amr-release-1.0-training-proxy.txt)
	log model
	testing (data set: amr-release-1.0-dev-proxy.txt)

Experiments:
	dev.proxy.exp -- single machine experiment.
	dev.proxy.dist.exp -- distributed experiment.
